# Order Summary Card

This project is a simple order summary card built with HTML and CSS. It demonstrates a clean, modern design featuring a banner image, order details, pricing information, and call-to-action buttons.

## Overview

The card is designed to display key order information in a visually appealing way. It includes:

- **Banner Image:** Displays a header image at the top of the card.
- **Order Summary:** A section with a heading and description text.
- **Amount Box:** Shows pricing details along with a "Change" option.
- **Payment Button:** A prominent button for making a payment.
- **Cancel Payment Link:** A link to cancel the payment process.

The card is centered in a full viewport container with a gradient background, making it ideal for modern web design projects.

## Files Included

- **index.html** – Contains the HTML markup for the card.
- **style.css** – Contains the CSS styling to create the layout and design.
- **Images:**
  - `banner.jpg` – The banner image displayed at the top of the card.
  - `download.jpg` – The image used in the amount section.

## Styling Details

- **Container:**  
  The `.container` class covers the full viewport with a gradient background. It uses flexbox to center the card both horizontally and vertically.

- **Card:**  
  The `.card` class creates a white card with rounded corners (40px radius) and a flexible, column-based layout.

- **Text Section:**  
  The `.textbox` class is used for the order summary text. It sets a large font size and generous spacing for clarity.

- **Amount Box:**  
  The `.amountBox` class creates a section with a contrasting background for displaying the amount and a "Change" link.

- **Buttons and Links:**  
  The payment button (`#buttonBox`) and cancel link (`.cancelBox a`) are styled with shadows, rounded corners, and specific font styles to draw attention.

*Note:* Some CSS sections are commented out, providing you the flexibility to modify and enhance the design further if needed.
